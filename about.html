            <div class="about_me">Hello everyone! My name is Cristina Massey and creator of Magic Mami.  I am a former teacher who retired for the moment to stay at home to raise our kids! Iâ€™ve always enjoyed cooking so thought about helping families with their cooking needs! 
              <br><br>I started cooking my last year of teaching. I made some breakfast tacos for my family in order to make it an easy morning where we could just grab and go.  That made me think how so many families could probably use that! So I started reaching out to the teachers I worked with to see if they would want breakfast tacos, which then turned into also making dips, which then turned into other menu items.
              Once I decided to stay home, I was able to expand my clientele and menu!<br><br> My main specialty is Mexican and Tex Mex food, with some other offerings as well.
              So basically, I release a menu every Tuesday night at 9pm.  Then I deliver your yummies the following Monday (Prosper area)/Tuesday (Plano area) mornings, sometimes Wednesday depending on volume. I also offer Porch pick up on Sundays.  I prefer porch drop off as much as possible. I do not charge delivery but will gladly accept any and all tips. 
              If you ever have any special get togethers/caterings let me know! I am able to come and deliver your large orders hot and ready to enjoy for your festivities!
              If you ever have any questions or requests let me know! Thank you so much to everyone who has entrusted me with feeding you and your family.  I am so humbled by all the response and by the word of mouth! Love you all! 
              Cristina</div>
